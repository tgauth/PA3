The game consists of sailors that can move between docks and ports, through simple commands. For example s 1 1 1, sails sailor 1 to location 1,1. Command p 1 2, sends sailor 1 to port 2 to drop off supplies. Command a 1, anchors sailor 1. Command d 2 1, sends sailor 2 to dock 1. Command h 3, hides sailor 3. Command g advances the time step by 1 so the each sailor is updated and moves depending on the commands given before.
